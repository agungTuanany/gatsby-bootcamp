# Gatsby-Bootcamp

Learn the basic concept using Gatsbyjs library stand with Reactjs, Making a static web more flexible. With gatsby configuration, I can make a Blog with convention by using 'markdown' type and that's why gatsby is so easy to setup, deploy and fast when site is loaded.

With GraphQL queries for fetching images makes Gatsby more lighter in development and remove the complexities of configuring environments and build tools. Instead I can focus on code.
